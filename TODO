    See, e.g. http://woudenberg.io/reducing-docker-image-size/

      When building a Docker image all intermediate layers become part
      of the final image. So, for example, if we create a 500 MB dummy
      file in the first step and delete it in the next step the layers is
      still part of the final image making it quite large.

      If we create and delete the file in the same step there will be
      no extra layers [...]
